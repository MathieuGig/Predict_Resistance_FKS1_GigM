Mathieu Giguere's Summer 2023 internship at the LandryLab. + Fall 2023 work.
Most coding files require to be in the same directory as Romain Durand's DMS-main repository. The code in my repository is made to work with it.
Be careful with absolute and relative file paths.

Folders:
'Other': All saves of my code. Mostly uncommented and unattended to.
'output': Some delivrables of my work.
