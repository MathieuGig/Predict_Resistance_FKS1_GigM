# Predict_Resistance_FKS1
Mathieu Gigu√®re's Summer 2023 internship at the LandryLab. + Fall 2023 work.\
Most coding files require to be in the same directory as Romain Durand's DMS-main repository. The code in my repository is made to work with it.
Be careful with absolute and relative file paths.

Folders :\
'Other' : All previous saves of my code. Mostly uncommented and unattended to.\
'output' : Some delivrables of my work.

Files :\
'all_indices_final_table_propensity.txt' : The amino acid properties used as features for machine learning.\
'logbook_Fall2023_GiguereMA.txt' : The logbook of my work during Fall 2023.\
'PredictResistance_GiguereMA_2023_11_29.py' : Python code to predict the resistance of FKS1 orthologs to echinocandins.\
'PredictResSinglesOtherDrug_Giguere_MA_2023_11_29.py' : Python code to predict the resistance of FKS1 single mutants to different echinocandins.\
'TableauFKS1.csv' : A result of my previous ortholog taxonomic analysis. I use it in 'PredictResistance_GiguereMA_2023_11_29.py'.\
